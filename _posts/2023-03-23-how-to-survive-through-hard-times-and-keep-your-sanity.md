>You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.
<br>Genesis 50:20

If you spend too much time in the past, you will drown in despair and stagnate. If you spend too much time thinking about the future, you will either torment yourself with anxiety or lose your head in the clouds. Yet, living _solely_ in the present limits your ground for decision-making. Looking back in the past allows you to better understand how you have changed, how your motivation for doing things evolved, and what mistakes you've made. It can remind you of your principles and help you apply this understanding to the situation at hand. Looking into the future gives you space to visualize how you want things to be, how they can turn out, and what needs to be done to incarnate this vision. Going back to the present, you combine these insights with any new knowledge you seek to finally solve an issue or make a decision.

Controlling the direction and scope of this perspective can not only be a decision-making tool but also a first-aid measure in an emergency situation.

Sometimes things are just really bad. There's nothing to do about them, and trying to think them through or rationalize what's happening will only be harmful to your mental state. That's when you can start shrinking the perspective: to days, hours, minutes, or even seconds. This can be a huge relief since you're not thinking about how to live through the day anymore. Now you need to live through this _minute_. Once it's passed, congratulations! You did it! Now, try making it through an hour. This may sound like a silly way of tricking yourself into not doing anything regretful, but when you're in a state of crisis, lifting this weight from your shoulders and allowing yourself to deal with everything later can be a necessary first aid to stop the cycle of negative thoughts.

The second thing, which has helped me a lot in the past, is a good old-fashioned "distract yourself from the bad thing". It's almost offensively obvious, but the problem is not that you don't know about this. The real challenge is training your brain to respond to the trigger with a distraction instead of the action you're trying to avoid. The general rule of thumb is that anything less harmful is better; the rest is a compromise. Sometimes you have no better option than to do what is usually considered harmful or at least useless.

In the moment, smoking a cigarette is better than engaging in direct physical self-harm. But in the long run, you wouldn't want to substitute one addiction for another. Or take social media, for example. While seeming like the most innocent alternative, they can derail your mental health even further (take [Braghieri et al.](https://web.archive.org/web/20230323132257/https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/260853/1/cesifo1_wp9723.pdf), for example). It's always a game of trade-offs, trying to balance out the bad and the worse.

Yet, playing with perspective and distracting yourself can only do so much. In the end, you will still feel miserable if there's nothing to look forward to in the future.

I've learned to embrace anticipation during one of the lowest points in my life, when there was nothing to look forward to in the next day. Anticipating something can often feel as good as experiencing it, if not better. And it doesn't even have to be some big event or reward. When things are tough on a constant basis, something as small as the anticipation of a hot meal or a comfy bed can really get you through the days.

Doing so can also make you more attentive to the small pleasures of life and act as a gratitude exercise. When you start thinking about the little things you look forward to, you start noticing that there are actually quite a few of them, regardless of how bad your life seems. The best thing is that you can create these small experiences for yourself.

Sometimes circumstances can be much more severe. Often things happen outside your control, but you are the one who has to deal with them. In situations like these, distraction or anticipation most likely won't help.

Not everyone is lucky enough to have a supportive family or friend group, but that doesn't mean you should be all alone. Remember, these tricks are nothing more than a mental band-aid. If you have no better options than to rely on them on a long-term basis, it may be a sign that there's a need for a deeper change.
