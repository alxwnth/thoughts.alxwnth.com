Ah, Google. How the tables have turned. Once a favorite website for millions, now an ad-data-selling conglomerate, has lost its human face.

In a data-driven economy, products and services become secondary to profits. Google maintains extensive user profiles, sometimes knowing more about their customers than the they know about themselves. Of course, this is handy since you get tailored search results, suggestions on what to watch, where to shop, and so on. Yet, the true cost of data is far more than the convenience provided by these services.

Also, centralization of, well, pretty much everything you do online is not good for security reasons. When you use five separate services that are not affiliated or connected with each other, getting access to each of them is a separate task. When your email, personal files, documents, location history, and dozens of other things you do online and offline are managed by a single account, getting access to it effectively means accessing your whole life.

You can have all the MFAs you want, make servers super secure, have 100 meter fences around data centers with dogs and everything, but this doesn’t help the core problem. Centralization is not good.

My point is that I would rather pay with money than with my privacy.

# What the Duck?

DuckDuckGo has been floating around my information space for a long time, and I even tried it a couple of times before, but eventually resorted back to Google. Yet, my growing displeasure with how big corporations handle personal information made me reconsider my priorities.

DuckDuckGo calls itself “an Internet privacy company”, implying that they are more than just a search engine now. And, in fact, this is true. At the moment of writing this, Duck’s range of products and services includes a search engine, a privacy-focused browser for desktop and mobile, and a browser extension for those not willing to give up their beloved Google Chrome or Safari. This extension not only blocks trackers but also displays the website’s privacy grade based on installed trackers and privacy policy (if it is known). Although its mechanism of grading is not fully clear, it is still a good reference when you’re considering whether to use a certain service or not.

# Good Duck

First things first, it feels nice not being tracked. Search results are less personalized but feel more organic. Ads don’t follow you for days after you’ve searched for something. Knowing that the product you are using is not restlessly crawling your data and feeding it into a machine learning model to show you more ads is like a breath of fresh air.

Ads in DuckDuckGo are way less intrusive and don’t take as much space as in Google. DuckDuckGo also promises that ads relate only to the search query you’ve entered, meaning if I looked up invoice software, it will not haunt me when I go to other websites and search for completely different things.

The search results are adequate by most part. In the time I’ve been using DuckDuckGo as my day-to-day search engine, I’ve been able to find pretty much everything I needed. And trust me, sometimes I search for pretty wild things on the internet.

Just like Google, it has handy snippets like video carousel, word definitions, translations, and many many more.

# Bad Duck

DuckDuckGo ads are managed by Microsoft. What a disgrace! I know, building your own ad network is an endeavor that requires colossal effort, but partnering with Microsoft? Come on, DuckDuckGo, you can do better than that! Some of its policies are even worse than Google’s. Also check this out:

> If you click on a Microsoft-provided ad, you will be redirected to the advertiser’s landing page through Microsoft Advertising’s platform. At that point, Microsoft Advertising will use your full IP address and user-agent string so that it can properly process the ad click and charge the advertiser.
> *Ads by Microsoft on DuckDuckGo Private Search | DuckDuckGo Help Pages*

Keep this in mind the next time you decide to click on an ad at DuckDuckGo.

Coming back to search results – they are not always as relevant as you expect. This can be especially painful if you’re used to throwing a few words into Google and expecting it to find everything for you. With DuckDuckGo, you need to learn how to search for things on the Internet again. This is the price you pay for a more private search.

# The Aftermath

In the end, DuckDuckGo has proven itself as a viable alternative to Google Search. It’s private. It doesn’t track your history. You ask a question – it gives an answer. What else is there to want from a search engine?

All things considered, I’m sticking to DuckDuckGo for now and don’t have any plans to go back to Google. Even more, my plans are to cut off Google as much as possible. Hopefully, one day I will delete my Gmail account and start living a free life in the woods.
